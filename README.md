📂     Flat File vs Relational Databases <br> <br>
 
Flat file databases store data in a single table or plain text file with no structured relationships, leading to redundancy and limited scalability. In contrast, relational databases organize data into multiple related tables using keys, allowing for efficient data retrieval, reduced redundancy, and better integrity. While flat files are simple and easy to use for small datasets, relational databases are more powerful and suited for complex, structured data management. <br> <br> <br>
 
 
 
Comparison Between Flat File and Databases: <br>
 
Feature 
Flat File System
Relational Database
Structure
Single table or text file
Multiple related tables (schema-based)
Data Redundancy
High – data often duplicated
Low – data normalized and relationships used
Relationships
No inherent support
Supports foreign keys and joins
Example Usage
CSV files, log files
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
Drawbacks
Poor scalability, no integrity constraints
More complex setup, needs RDBMS software

🧠 DBMS Advantages – Mind Map
 
  <br>
A Database Management System (DBMS) offers a structured and efficient way to store, manage, and access data. It provides several key advantages such as enhanced security, data integrity, reduced redundancy, concurrent access, reliable backups, and easy data sharing. These features make DBMS essential for maintaining accurate, consistent, and accessible data in modern applications and organizations.

Below is a concise mind map illustrating the key advantages of a Database Management System (DBMS):
 
￼
 
  <br>
In summary, a Database Management System (DBMS) plays a vital role in modern data management by offering structured, secure, and efficient access to information. Its key advantages—such as enhanced security, data integrity, reduced redundancy, support for concurrent access, reliable backup solutions, and streamlined data sharing—make it indispensable for organizations of all sizes. By centralizing data control and ensuring consistency, a DBMS supports better decision-making, operational efficiency, and long-term scalability in today’s data-driven environments.

👥     Roles in a Database System
 
In a database system, various specialized roles work together to ensure the successful design, development, and maintenance of the database infrastructure. Each role contributes specific expertise, from gathering requirements to building applications and generating insights. The following table outlines the key roles involved in a database project and summarizes their primary responsibilities.
 
  <br>
The following are key roles within a database system team, along with their respective responsibilities:
 
        Role
Responsibilities
System Analyst
 
Gathers user requirements and translates them into database needs.
Database Designer
Creates the logical and physical structure of the database.
Database Developer
 
Writes SQL code, stored procedures, and handles data manipulation logic.
 
Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages database performance, security, backups, and access.
 
Application Developer
 
Builds apps that interact with the database through queries/APIs.
BI Developer

🧩     Types of Databases
 
Databases come in various types, each designed to meet specific data storage and access needs. From traditional relational databases to modern non-relational, centralized, distributed, and cloud-based systems, each type offers unique features, structures, and use cases depending on the application's requirements.
 
Relational vs Non-Relational:
 
The comparison below highlights the key differences between Relational and Non-Relational:
 
Feature
Relational (RDBMS)
Non-Relational (NoSQL)
Structure
Tables with rows & columns
Key-Value, Document, Column, Graph
Examples
MySQL, PostgreSQL
MongoDB, Cassandra
Best For
Structured, normalized data
Unstructured or dynamic data
 
 
Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud Databases
 
The comparison below highlights the key differences Centralized, Distributed and Cloud Databases:
 
 
Type
 
 
Description
 
Use Case Example
Centralized
All data in one location/server
Small business systems
Distributed
Data spread across multiple physical locations

☁️     Cloud Storage and Databases
 
  <br>
            📦 What is Cloud Storage?
  <br>
Cloud storage is a model where data is stored on remote servers accessed via the internet. It supports databases by offering elastic scalability, remote access, and integrated backup.
 
 
  <br>
🌐  Cloud-Based DB Advantages <br> <br>
 
            ·  Auto-scaling and high availability <br>
·  Reduced hardware cost <br>
·  Easy maintenance and monitoring tools <br>
·  Accessible from anywhere <br>
 
 <br>
⚠️     Challenges <br> <br>
 
            ·  Security & data privacy concerns <br>
·  Network latency <br>
·  Dependency on cloud provider <br>
·  Ongoing operational cost <br>
